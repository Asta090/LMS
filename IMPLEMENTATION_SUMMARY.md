# LMS Project Implementation Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Profile Settings

**Problem**: Profile settings and user profile management were missing for all user roles (admin, teacher, student).

**Solution**:
- Created a comprehensive ProfilePage component that works for all roles
- Connected to existing backend API endpoints for profile management
- Added routes in App.tsx for all roles
- Added profile links in the navigation menu
- Added profile dropdown in the header

### 2. Inconsistent Layout and Theme

**Problem**: There were inconsistencies in the UI components, particularly between BrowseCoursesPage and other components.

**Solution**:
- Updated all pages to use DashboardLayout for consistency
- Standardized styling with common theme elements
- Fixed color inconsistencies in components
- Updated Sidebar.tsx to match the application design

### 3. Logout Functionality Issues

**Problem**: Logout button in Sidebar.tsx was not properly connected to the logout function in AuthContext.

**Solution**:
- Connected the logout button to the AuthContext's logout function
- Added a dropdown menu for user profile with logout option
- Ensured proper navigation after logout

### 4. Course Progress Tracking

**Problem**: Course progress tracking was not implemented, showing only mock data.

**Solution**:
- Created an Enrollment model with progress tracking functionality
- Added API endpoint for updating course progress
- Updated StudentDashboard to fetch real enrollment data

- Added loading states and error handling

### 6. API Connectivity Issues

**Problem**: Missing API endpoints and frontend connections for key functionality.
